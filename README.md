## [simbas.github.com/n3dsite](http://simbas.github.com/n3dsite)

### Example of an optimized website for nintendo 3DS :

 - Dual screen
 - D-Pad
 - Touchless navigation
 - 3D images

#### JavaScript

 - Vanilla JS
 - Based on focus/blur events
 - Use scrollTo() to prevent the user from scrolling
 - Selecting anchors via the CSS3 selector **a[href$='.mpo']**

#### CSS

 - Top screen is 400x220px
 - Bottom screen is 320x212px
 - Use **background** property to preview the 3D images

#### More

Maybe will be avaible as a library/boilterplate to reuse to make 3DS gallery sites.
